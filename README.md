A simple visualization library

Dependencies:
SDL2 library
Visual Studio

SDL2 Installation:
1. Download the library via SDL's own website:
https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php
Scroll down to "Development Libraries" and choose: 
Visual C++

2. Now go into your project folder. At the same place where your [.sln] is create a new directory.
The name of the folder is optional but here it's called "deps" for short.
Extract your downloaded SDL2 package.
Navigate inside the SDL2 package to the "include" folder and drag it inside "deps".
Open the "lib" file in the package, depending on your system chose either 64bit(x64) or 32bit(x86).
Create a new folder inside "deps" called "lib" and drag all [.lib] files to that position.
